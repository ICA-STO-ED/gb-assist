    content: The AMR replaces manual labour in the transportation of materials and semi/fully completed products around the factory floor during production process. As a collaborative robot for automated internal transportation, AMR comes with autonomous functions to identify obstacles and navigate around factory floor without need for markers or coming to a complete stop for an extended period.
