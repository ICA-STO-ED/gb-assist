## Manpower Support

#### Jobs Growth Incentive (JGI)

As announced on 17 August 2020 Ministerial Statement, to support hiring in sectors that are doing well – such as the biomedical sciences, financial services, and ICT sectors – we will launch the Jobs Growth Incentive (JGI).

The JGI will support firms in hiring of local workers, with a special focus on our mature workers. 
* The Government will co-pay up to 25% of salaries of all new local hires for one year, subject to a cap.
* For those aged 40 and above, the co-payment to firms will be up to 50%.

More details will be provided in due course.  

#### Transform and Grow

The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and Workforce Singapore (WSG), in collaboration with the Public Service Division (PSD) and various government agencies, have launched the SGUnited Jobs Initiative and SGUnited Traineeships Programme to create jobs over the next one year.

This is a concerted effort as part of the Resilience Budget to create more opportunities for jobseekers and workers affected by the current COVID-19 situation, as well as match them to jobs available, including new jobs created as a result of COVID-19. The initiative also seeks to help businesses that are recruiting for the eventual recovery, as well as those with short-term manpower needs due to disruptions in labour supply.

Whether you are looking to tackle the ongoing economic challenges, attract and retain local manpower, or improve productivity and innovation, WSG has the following programmes to provide you with support and resources customised for your manpower needs.
